# hospital-price-transparency-workshop
Workshop on using natural language processing and deep learning applied to hospital price transparency data. 

## Day 1 of the workshop:

* notebook: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1L4QkgrOowrrQtC7jgVTv1p6DtFgpjXvx?usp=sharing
* whiteboard: https://app.excalidraw.com/l/1mBnVe9NaES/74OqBRSPJV9

> Homework! Take a look at this file - and think about what health equity questions you might want to answer with it, or what datasets (like the census, or other things related to health equity/health outcomes / social determinants of health) we might be able to analyze concurrently - https://github.com/onefact/hospital-price-transparency-workshop/blob/main/ohiohealth.com-out-of-pocket-estimates-31-4446959_obleness_standardcharges-xlsx-mapped-to-CMS-RVU-CPT-descriptions.csv

Email your desired analyses to jaan@onefact.org.

## Homework for Day 2 of the workshop:

* notebook: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ko6z7Ypl2FXT3LK15AYArcZTYAL_QTPv?usp=sharing

> Homework! * If you have taken or learned statistics: think about what methods you might use to predict hospital prices from count-valued random variables (like what we created in the vector representations of text)

> From a health equity point of view: what words, procedures, service classes (inpatient/outpatient/medication) would you expect to be correlated to a higher price? (Can we recover patterns we would expect from a health equity point of view from the machine learning model we will train tomorrow: for example, if outpatient procedures are unlikely to be covered by Medicare/Medicaid, are those more expensive?)
